High level Java API for handling archives (.tar, .tar.gz and .tar.xz).

```java
Tar tar = new Tar("file-name");
TarGz targz = new TarGz("file-name");
TarXz tarxz = new TarXz("file-name");

tar.addFile(fileOrFolder); // Works the same for TarGz and TarXz
```
Note that this is still in early development so the example might have changed and some things are not working yet.

## Motivation
I wasn't able to find a Java lib/api that was simple and easy to use and covered multiple archive types in a single lib.
Thus I started this project with the aim of having a high level, simple Java lib to handle archive files.
